# SMS ChatGPT

This project integrates Twilio's SMS service with OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide automated responses to SMS messages.

## Motivation

I use a dumb phone as my daily driver, and the only missing feature was ChatGPT integration. Here it is.

## Approximated costs

**DISCLAIMER:** My calculations are an estimate and specific to my geography and usage. Please do your own math before using it. All responsibility for the correctness of the calculations and incurred costs is yours.

### 100 messages/month

- Twilio: $3 (phone number) + $7.90 (outbound SMS @ $0.079/msg) + $3.80 (inbound SMS @ $0.038/msg) = $14.70
- OpenAI API: ~$0.05
- Total: ~$14.75/month

### 30 messages/month

- Twilio: $3 (phone number) + $2.37 (outbound SMS) + $1.14 (inbound SMS) = $6.51/month
- OpenAI API: ~$0.015
- Total: ~$6.53/month
